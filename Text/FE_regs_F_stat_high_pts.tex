We calculated the $F$-statistic to test the restriction 
that the parameters are the same for both male and female drivers. 
The unrestricted sum of squared residuals was 1,819,827. 
The restricted sum of squared residuals was 1,819,351. 
The value of the $F$-statistic was -4,088, 
which corresponds to a $p$-value of nearly zero, since the $F$-statistic is much higher than 
 the one percent critical value of 1.4857. 
This strongly suggests that male and female driving behaviour should be modeled separately.
